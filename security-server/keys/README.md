# Insecure Keypair

These keys are an **insecure** public/private keypair used to
facilitate easy setup of the Awesome ATO Automation demo.

For anything other than a demonstration running inside your own
computer, you should use `ssh-keygen` or the like to create your own
keypair, and follow your normal security practices for handling
public/private keypairs.
